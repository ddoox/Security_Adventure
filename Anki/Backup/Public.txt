Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a TCP handshake?	A TCP handshake is a process that occurs when two devices establish a connection over a TCP/IP network.		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is the purpose of the TCP handshake?	"The TCP handshake allows devices to establish a reliable and orderly 
connection before exchanging data. It ensures that both the client and 
server are ready to communicate and sets up parameters for the data 
transmission, such as sequence numbers and window sizes."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What are the three steps of the TCP handshake?	<div>The three steps of the TCP handshake are:</div><ol><li>SYN: The client sends a SYN packet to the server.</li><li>SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet.</li><li>ACK: The client sends an ACK packet back to the server.</li></ol>		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is Network Address Translation (NAT)?	"Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used to conserve IPv4 
addresses by allowing multiple devices within a private network to share
 a single public IPv4 address. NAT translates private IP addresses to a 
public IP address when communicating over the Internet."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What are the classes of IPv4 addresses?	"IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Classes
 A, B, and C are used for unicast addresses (one-to-one communication), 
Class D is used for multicast addresses (one-to-many communication), and
 Class E is reserved for experimental use."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What are the main components of an IPv4 packet?	<div>The main components of an IPv4 packet include:</div><ol><li>Header: Contains control information such as source and destination IP addresses, packet length, protocol type, Time-to-Live (TTL), and header checksum.</li><li>Payload: Contains the actual data being transmitted, such as the contents of a web page, email message, or file.</li><li>Optional fields: Some IPv4 packets may include optional fields such as options or padding.</li></ol>		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	How does NAT overload work?	"In NAT overload, each outgoing packet from a device within the private 
network is translated to have the same public IP address but a unique 
port number. When the response packets return from the Internet, the NAT
 device uses the port number to determine which device within the 
private network to forward the packet to."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is the IPv6 address format?	"IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal 
digits, separated by colons (:). For example, 
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. IPv6 addresses may also include
 a double colon (::) to represent consecutive groups of zeros, allowing 
for address compression."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What are the types of IPv6 addresses?	<ol><li>Unicast addresses: Identifies a single interface on a network and is used for one-to-one communication.</li><li>Multicast addresses: Used to send packets to multiple recipients simultaneously and are used for one-to-many communication.</li><li>Anycast addresses: Assigned to multiple interfaces, but packets are delivered to the nearest (topologically closest) interface, typically used for one-to-nearest communication.</li></ol>		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What are the types of unicast IPv6 addresses?	<div>Unicast IPv6 addresses can be categorized into several types, including:</div><ol><li>Global Unicast Address</li><li>Link-Local Address</li><li>Unique Local Address</li><li>Loopback Address</li></ol>		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a Global Unicast Address IPv6?	"A Global Unicast Address is an IPv6 address that is globally unique and 
routable on the IPv6 Internet. It is equivalent to public IPv4 addresses
 and is used for communication between devices across different networks
 on the Internet."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a Link-Local Address IPv6?	"A Link-Local Address is an IPv6 address that is automatically configured
 on an interface for communication within the local network segment 
(link). It is primarily used for neighbor discovery, address 
autoconfiguration, and other link-local communication tasks."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a Unique Local Address (ULA) IPv6?	"A Unique Local Address (ULA) is an IPv6 address used for communication 
within a private network, similar to IPv4 private addresses (e.g., 
10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16). ULAs are not routable on the IPv6 Internet 
and are intended for local use within an organization or site."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a Loopback Address IPv6?	"A Loopback Address is a special IPv6 address used to send traffic back 
to the same device for testing and troubleshooting purposes. In IPv6, 
the loopback address is represented as ::1/128, similar to the IPv4 
loopback address 127.0.0.1."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is DNS?	"DNS, or Domain Name System, is a hierarchical decentralized naming 
system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the 
Internet or a private network. It translates domain names, which are 
easy-to-remember human-readable addresses, into numerical IP addresses 
used by computers to identify each other on the network."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	How does DNS work?	"DNS works by translating domain names into IP addresses through a 
distributed network of servers. When a user enters a domain name into 
their web browser, the browser sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver 
(typically provided by the Internet Service Provider or a third-party 
DNS provider). The resolver then queries DNS servers in a hierarchical 
manner until it finds the IP address associated with the requested 
domain name, which it returns to the browser."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What are the main components of DNS?	<div>The main components of DNS include:</div><ol><li>DNS Resolver: Software on a client device or network that sends DNS queries and receives DNS responses.</li><li>DNS Server: Servers that store DNS records and respond to DNS queries from resolvers. DNS servers can be authoritative servers, caching servers, or recursive servers.</li><li>DNS Record: Data stored on DNS servers that maps domain names to IP addresses or provides other information such as mail server addresses (MX records) or service location information (SRV records).</li></ol>		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is an authoritative DNS server?	"An authoritative DNS server is a DNS server that contains the official 
DNS records for a specific domain. When queried about a domain name, an 
authoritative DNS server provides the definitive answer for that domain 
based on the information stored in its DNS records."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a recursive DNS server?	"A recursive DNS server is a DNS server that processes DNS queries on 
behalf of clients by recursively querying other DNS servers until it 
obtains the final answer. Recursive DNS servers are typically provided 
by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or third-party DNS providers and 
are responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is DNS caching?	"DNS caching is the practice of temporarily storing DNS query results 
(i.e., resolved IP addresses) in memory on a DNS server or client 
device. Caching helps improve DNS query response times by allowing 
subsequent queries for the same domain name to be answered from the 
cache rather than querying authoritative DNS servers again. DNS caching 
reduces network traffic and improves overall DNS performance."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is DNSSEC?	"DNSSEC, or Domain Name System Security Extensions, is a suite of 
security protocols that adds cryptographic authentication and integrity 
checks to DNS data. DNSSEC helps prevent DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, 
and other types of DNS-based attacks by ensuring the authenticity and 
integrity of DNS responses."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	How does ARP work?	"When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same 
network, it checks its ARP cache (a table of IP-to-MAC address mappings)
 to see if it already knows the MAC address corresponding to the 
destination IP address. If the MAC address is not in the cache, the 
device sends out an ARP request broadcast packet to all devices on the 
network, asking for the MAC address associated with the destination IP 
address. The device that has the matching IP address responds with an 
ARP reply packet containing its MAC address, and the requesting device 
updates its ARP cache with the new mapping."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is ARP poisoning?	"ARP poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing or ARP cache poisoning, is a 
network attack in which an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a 
local network with the aim of associating the attacker's MAC address 
with the IP address of another network device. This can lead to traffic 
redirection, interception, or other malicious activities, as the 
attacker can intercept and manipulate network traffic intended for the 
targeted device."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is ARP flooding?	"ARP flooding is a type of network attack in which an attacker sends a 
large number of ARP request packets to a target network with the aim of 
overwhelming the ARP cache of devices on the network. By flooding the 
network with ARP requests, the attacker can cause network congestion, 
disrupt network communication, or trigger instability in network 
devices."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is ICMP?	"ICMP, or Internet Control Message Protocol, is a network layer protocol 
used for diagnostic and control purposes within IP networks. It is 
commonly used for error reporting, network troubleshooting, and 
management tasks, such as ping and traceroute."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is ICMP ping?	"ICMP ping, often referred to simply as ""ping,"" is a network utility used
 to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network
 and measure the round-trip time for packets to travel from the source 
to the destination and back. Ping works by sending ICMP echo request 
packets to the target host and waiting for ICMP echo reply packets in 
response. The round-trip time (RTT) is calculated based on the time 
difference between sending the echo request and receiving the echo 
reply."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is ICMP traceroute?	"ICMP traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the route 
taken by packets from the source to a specified destination host. 
Traceroute works by sending a series of UDP or ICMP echo request packets
 with increasing TTL (Time-to-Live) values, causing intermediate routers
 to send ICMP time exceeded messages when the TTL expires. By analyzing 
the source IP addresses of the ICMP time exceeded messages received, 
traceroute can determine the path taken by packets through the network."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a MAC address?	"A MAC address, or Media Access Control address, is a unique identifier 
assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication on a 
network. It is a hardware address burned into the network adapter's 
firmware by the manufacturer and is used at the data link layer of the 
OSI model to uniquely identify devices on a network."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is the format of a MAC address?	"A MAC address is typically represented as a series of six pairs of 
hexadecimal digits, separated by colons, dashes, or no separators. For 
example, ""00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"" or ""00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E"". Each pair of 
hexadecimal digits represents one byte of the MAC address, with the 
first three pairs identifying the manufacturer of the network adapter 
and the last three pairs providing a unique identifier for the device."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	Can MAC addresses be changed?	"In most cases, MAC addresses are hardcoded into the firmware of network 
adapters by the manufacturer and cannot be changed. However, some 
network interfaces support MAC address spoofing, a technique that allows
 the user to temporarily change the MAC address of the network adapter 
through software. MAC address spoofing can be used for legitimate 
purposes such as network testing, troubleshooting, or privacy 
protection, but it can also be abused for malicious activities such as 
network impersonation or bypassing access controls."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a VLAN?	"A VLAN, or Virtual Local Area Network, is a logical grouping of devices 
within a physical network that communicate with each other as if they 
were on the same physical network, even though they may be located on 
different physical LAN segments. VLANs are created to improve network 
security, flexibility, and scalability by segmenting broadcast domains 
and controlling traffic flow within a network."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a trunk port?	"A trunk port is a network port on a switch that is configured to carry 
traffic for multiple VLANs simultaneously. Trunk ports are typically 
used to interconnect switches or routers and carry traffic between 
VLANs. They use VLAN tagging to identify and segregate traffic for 
different VLANs, allowing VLAN-aware devices to communicate across the 
network while maintaining VLAN isolation and segmentation."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is IEEE 802.1X?	"IEEE 802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control (PNAC). 
It provides an authentication framework for controlling access to 
Ethernet networks and Wi-Fi networks. IEEE 802.1X allows network 
administrators to restrict network access based on the identity of the 
user or device, providing an additional layer of security beyond simple 
network connectivity."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is an Autonomous System (AS)?	"An Autonomous System (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol
 (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network 
operators that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the 
Internet. ASes are fundamental units of routing in the Internet and are 
identified by a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN)."		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is the role of an Autonomous System?	"The primary role of an Autonomous System is to facilitate the routing of
 network traffic within and between networks. Each Autonomous System has
 its own routing policies, which determine how traffic is routed within 
the AS and how it is exchanged with other ASes. ASes use exterior 
routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange 
routing information and make decisions about how to forward traffic to 
its destination."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	How do spoof attacks work?	"Spoof attacks work by manipulating network protocols to falsify the 
source IP address, MAC address, or other identifying information in 
network packets. Common spoofing techniques include IP address spoofing,
 where the attacker modifies the source IP address of packets to appear 
as if they are coming from a trusted source, and DNS spoofing, where the
 attacker manipulates DNS responses to redirect users to malicious 
websites or servers."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What are the different types of spoof attacks? (6)	<div>Common types of spoof attacks include:</div><ol><li>IP address spoofing: Falsifying the source IP address in network packets to impersonate another device or network.</li><li>MAC address spoofing: Falsifying the source MAC address in data frames to impersonate another network interface.</li><li>DNS spoofing: Manipulating DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites or servers.</li><li>ARP spoofing: Poisoning ARP caches to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another network device, leading to traffic interception or redirection.</li><li>Email spoofing: Falsifying the sender's email address in email messages to impersonate another user or domain, commonly used in phishing attacks.</li><li>Caller ID spoofing: Manipulating caller ID information in telephone calls to disguise the caller's identity or impersonate another phone number.</li></ol>		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is a DoS attack?	"A DoS (Denial of Service) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the 
normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by 
overwhelming it with a flood of illegitimate traffic or resource 
requests. The goal of a DoS attack is to make the targeted system or 
network unavailable to its intended users, rendering it unable to 
respond to legitimate requests."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What are the different types of DoS attacks?(5)	<div>Common types of DoS attacks include:</div><ol><li>SYN flood: Exploits the three-way handshake process of the TCP protocol by sending a large number of SYN requests to the target, overwhelming its capacity to handle incoming connection requests.</li><li>UDP flood: Floods the target with a large volume of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, typically spoofed with random source IP addresses, to consume bandwidth and overwhelm network resources.</li><li>ICMP flood: Sends a flood of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, such as ping requests, to the target, causing network congestion and resource exhaustion.</li><li>HTTP flood: Launches a flood of HTTP requests to a web server, overwhelming its capacity to process incoming requests and causing it to become unresponsive.</li><li>DNS amplification: Exploits misconfigured DNS servers to send large responses to forged DNS queries, amplifying the volume of traffic directed at the target and causing a denial of service.</li></ol>		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack?	"A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cyberattack where an 
attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two 
parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. The
 attacker secretly relays and possibly modifies the communication 
without the knowledge or consent of the communicating parties, allowing 
them to eavesdrop on sensitive information, steal credentials, or 
manipulate data."

confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in transit and at rest."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	How does PGP work?	"<div>PGP works based on the following principles:</div><ol><li>Public-key cryptography: PGP uses asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, to encrypt and decrypt data. Each user has a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption and can be freely distributed, while the private key is kept secret and used for decryption.</li><li>Encryption: When a user wants to send an encrypted message or file to another user, they use the recipient's public key to encrypt the data. Only the recipient, who possesses the corresponding private key, can decrypt the data using their private key.</li><li>Digital signatures: PGP also supports digital signatures, which provide authentication and integrity verification for electronic communications. Users can sign their messages or files using their private key to generate a digital signature. Recipients can verify the signature using the sender's public key to ensure that the message has not been tampered with and originated from the claimed sender.</li><li>Web of trust: PGP relies on a decentralized trust model called the web of trust, where users validate and vouch for each other's public keys. Users can sign each other's public keys to indicate trust and authenticity. Over time, a network of trusted relationships is formed, enabling users to verify the authenticity of public keys and validate digital signatures.
Overall, PGP provides end-to-end encryption, digital signatures, and authentication mechanisms to protect electronic communications and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between users. It's widely used for secure email communication, file encryption, data protection, and digital identity verification in both personal and professional contexts.</li></ol>"		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is hashing?	"Hashing is a cryptographic technique used to convert data of arbitrary 
size into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value or 
hash digest. The output of a hash function is unique for each unique

Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What are the HTTP request methods?	<div>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines several request methods or verbs that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL. Each HTTP request method has specific semantics and is used for different purposes:</div><ol><li><div>GET: The GET method requests data from a specified resource. It retrieves information from the server without modifying the resource's state. GET requests are idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times will produce the same result.</div></li><li><div>POST: The POST method submits data to be processed to a specified resource. It typically sends data to the server for processing, such as submitting form data or uploading a file. POST requests can modify the resource's state and are not idempotent.</div></li><li><div>PUT: The PUT method updates or replaces a specified resource with the provided data. It is used to update existing resources or create new resources if they do not exist. PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times has the same effect.</div></li><li><div>DELETE: The DELETE method deletes a specified resource from the server. It removes the resource from the server's storage. DELETE requests are idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times has the same effect.</div></li><li><div>PATCH: The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource. It is used to update specific fields or properties of a resource without replacing the entire resource. PATCH requests are not necessarily idempotent.</div></li><li><div>HEAD: The HEAD method requests headers from a specified resource without requesting the resource's content. It is often used to check the resource's metadata, such as its content type or last modified date, before retrieving the full content with a GET request.</div></li><li><div>OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method requests information about the communication options available for a specified resource. It is used to determine which HTTP methods are supported by the server for a particular resource.</div></li><li><div>TRACE: The TRACE method performs a loop-back test to the server. It echoes the received request back to the client, allowing the client to see what changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.</div></li></ol><div>These HTTP request methods provide a standardized way for clients to interact with web servers and perform various actions on resources over the web.</div>		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is a stateless protocol?	"A stateless protocol is a communication protocol that treats each 
request as an independent transaction, without any knowledge of previous
 requests or interactions. In a stateless protocol, the server does not 
maintain any information or state about the client's previous 
interactions, sessions, or requests. Each request from the client to the
 server is self-contained and contains all the information necessary for
 the server to process it without relying on any prior context.<br><br><br><div>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a widely used example of a stateless protocol. Each HTTP request from a client to a server is treated as an independent transaction, and the server does not maintain any session state or client-specific data between requests. This statelessness allows web servers to handle a large number of concurrent clients and scale horizontally to meet increasing demand.</div><br>"		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is an HTTP session?	<div>An HTTP session refers to a series of related HTTP requests and responses exchanged between a client and a server within a specific timeframe or context. HTTP sessions are used to maintain stateful communication between a client and a server over the stateless HTTP protocol.</div><div>Key characteristics of HTTP sessions include:</div><ol><li><div>Session initiation: An HTTP session typically begins when a client sends an initial HTTP request to a server, such as a request to access a web page or authenticate a user.</div></li><li><div>Session identification: During the session initiation, the server assigns a unique session identifier, often in the form of a session cookie or URL parameter, to the client. This identifier is used to associate subsequent requests from the same client with the ongoing session.</div></li><li><div>Session state: As the client interacts with the server, session state information may be maintained on the server-side to track the client's activities, preferences, and authentication status throughout the session. This session state can include data such as user authentication tokens, shopping cart contents, or application settings.</div></li><li><div>Session management: The server is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the HTTP session, including session creation, expiration, and termination. Session management mechanisms ensure that session data is maintained securely and that sessions are properly terminated when they are no longer needed or become inactive.</div></li><li><div>Stateful communication: HTTP sessions enable stateful communication between the client and server over the stateless HTTP protocol. By associating multiple requests from the same client with a common session context, servers can maintain continuity and context-awareness throughout the client's interaction with the application or service.</div></li></ol><div>HTTP sessions are commonly used in web applications to support user authentication, session-based workflows, and personalized user experiences. Session management frameworks and technologies, such as session cookies, URL rewriting, and server-side session storage mechanisms, facilitate the implementation and management of HTTP sessions in web applications.</div>

Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is the HTTP flow?	<div>The HTTP flow refers to the sequence of steps involved in a typical HTTP request-response cycle between a client and a server. It includes the following stages:</div><ol><li><div>Client sends a request: The client (e.g., web browser) initiates the HTTP request by sending a request message to the server. The request message includes the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), the URL of the requested resource, and optional headers and data.</div></li><li><div>Server processes the request: Upon receiving the request, the server processes it based on the requested resource and the specified HTTP method. This may involve accessing data, executing scripts, or performing other actions to generate the response.</div></li><li><div>Server sends a response: After processing the request, the server generates an HTTP response message containing the requested resource, along with status information and optional headers. The response is then sent back to the client.</div></li><li><div>Client receives the response: The client receives the HTTP response from the server and processes it accordingly. This may involve rendering HTML content, executing scripts, or handling other types of data returned by the server.</div></li><li><div>Connection closes (optional): Depending on the connection type (e.g., persistent or non-persistent), the connection between the client and server may remain open for future requests or be closed after completing the current request-response cycle.</div></li></ol>		
Basic	Public::85 - Networks	What is the HTTP/2 flow?	"<div>The HTTP/2 flow refers to the sequence of steps involved in a typical HTTP/2 request-response cycle between a client and a server. It builds upon the concepts of HTTP/1.x but introduces several optimizations to improve performance and efficiency. Here's how the HTTP/2 flow typically unfolds:</div><ol><li><div>Connection establishment: The client initiates a connection to the server using the HTTP/2 protocol. This connection may be established over TCP or TLS, depending on whether encryption is used.</div></li><li><div>Request multiplexing: Within the established connection, the client can send multiple HTTP requests concurrently over a single connection. These requests are divided into smaller units called ""frames"" and interleaved for efficient transmission.</div></li><li><div>Header compression: HTTP/2 uses header compression techniques, such as HPACK, to reduce the overhead of transmitting HTTP headers. This reduces bandwidth usage and improves performance, especially for requests with large headers.</div></li><li><div>Server push (optional): The server can initiate server push, where it proactively sends resources to the client before they are requested. This feature allows servers to push critical resources, such as CSS or JavaScript files, to the client's cache, reducing latency and improving page load times.</div></li><li><div>Stream prioritization: HTTP/2 allows clients to assign priority levels to individual streams, indicating their relative importance. This enables servers to prioritize the delivery of critical resources and optimize resource allocation based on client requirements.</div></li><li><div>Response multiplexing: Similarly to request multiplexing, the server can send multiple HTTP responses concurrently over the same connection. This improves efficiency by reducing the latency associated with opening and closing multiple connections for each request-response cycle.</div></li><li><div>Flow control: HTTP/2 incorporates flow control mechanisms to prevent overload and congestion on the network. Flow control ensures that data is transmitted at a rate that the client can handle, preventing buffer overflow and improving overall performance.</div></li><li><div>Connection termination: Once the client has received all the requested resources and completed the interaction with the server, the HTTP/2 connection can be terminated. However, HTTP/2 also supports connection reuse, allowing subsequent requests to be sent over the same connection, further improving efficiency.</div></li></ol>"

 layer of security by requiring physical authentication tokens, such as 
USB security keys, in addition to passwords, to access accounts or 
systems."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What are the two ceremonies in U2F?	The two ceremonies in U2F are the registration ceremony and the authentication ceremony.		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is the registration ceremony in U2F?	"The registration ceremony involves associating a U2F device with a user 
account. During this process, the user authenticates themselves to the 
service provider using their username and password, and then registers 
the U2F device with the account. This typically involves pressing a 
button on the U2F device to generate a cryptographic key pair that is 
securely stored by both the device and the service provider."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What is the authentication ceremony in U2F?	"The authentication ceremony occurs each time the user attempts to log in
 to their account using U2F. During this process, the user presents 
their username, password, and U2F device to the service provider. The 
service provider verifies the user's credentials and requests 
authentication from the U2F device. The user then confirms the 
authentication by pressing a button on the U2F device, which generates a
 response that is sent back to the service provider for verification. If
 the response is valid, the user is granted access to their account."		
Basic	Public::83 - Linux	What does a space before linux command?	"Including a space before a command 
prevents the command from being stored in the shell's history file. This
 is often used for commands that contain sensitive information, such as 
passwords or API keys, to prevent them from being saved in plaintext in 
the shell history file, which could be accessed by other users or tools.
 By adding a space before the command, it is executed as a shell command
 without being recorded in the history."		
Basic	Public::80 - Security	What are the parties involved in U2F?	<ol><li>User: John, who is attempting to log in to his email account.</li><li>Service Provider: Gmail, the email service provider that requires U2F authentication for login.</li><li>U2F Device: YubiKey, a physical security key owned by John and used for authentication.</li><li>Relying Party: Gmail's authentication server, which relies on U2F authentication to verify John's identity and grant access to his email account.</li></ol>
